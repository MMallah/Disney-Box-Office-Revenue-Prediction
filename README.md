Disney Studios has produced more than 600 films since their debut film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937. While many of its films were big hits, some of them were not. In this notebook, we will explore a dataset of Disney movies and analyze what contributes to the success of Disney movies.

* Load and inspect the data. 
* Explore some <code>descriptive statistics</code> and <code>visualize trends</code> .
* Use <code>One hot encoding</code> to prepare <code>categorical variables</code> for linear regression.
* Use <code>Bootstrapping</code> method and <code>confidence intervals</code> to validate results.
